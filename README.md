# CatMerge â€“ Easily Merge Media Files

[ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutsche Version](README_de.md)

**CatMerge** is a Nautilus script that allows you to merge video or audio files directly in your file manager.  
Perfect for recordings from **action cams or drones**, which are often split into 4 GB segments.

The script attempts to merge files **losslessly** using `ffmpeg -c copy`.  
If this is not possible (e.g., due to variable bitrate), you will be prompted to allow a **re-encoding**.
